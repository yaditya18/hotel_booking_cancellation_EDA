 Exploring Hotel Booking Cancellation Patterns 🏨📊**

 👋🏼 Excited to share some insights from my recent data analysis project focused on hotel booking cancellations. 🏨💼

🔍 **Data Analysis Highlights:**
After diving deep into the dataset and performing thorough data cleaning, I delved into various aspects of hotel booking cancellations. Here's a quick rundown of what I uncovered:

📊 **Cancellation Rate by Arrival Date Month:**
I started by exploring how the cancellation rate varies across different months of the year. The insights revealed some interesting seasonal trends that hoteliers could leverage to optimize their booking strategies.

📊 **Lead Time vs. Cancellation:**
A closer look at lead time – the duration between booking and check-in – provided insights into how guests' planning horizon affects cancellation rates. The findings underscore the importance of early bookings and targeted marketing campaigns.

📊 **ADR per Month Analysis:**
Analyzing the Average Daily Rate (ADR) across different months shed light on pricing strategies that could influence booking behavior and, consequently, cancellations.

🌍 **Country-Wise Cancellation Patterns:**
By segmenting cancellations by country of origin, I identified regions with higher cancellation rates. This information can help hotels tailor their services and policies to cater to diverse international guest preferences.

📊 **Cancellation Rates for Weekdays:**
Visualizing cancellation rates for weekdays revealed intriguing patterns in guests' behavior based on the day of the week. This could guide hotels in optimizing staffing levels and resource allocation.

🔄 **Percentage of Canceled Bookings Among Repeated Guests:**
Examining the cancellation behavior of repeated guests showed how loyal customers compare to the overall guest population. This insight has implications for guest loyalty programs and retention strategies.

🔍 **Takeaways:**
The analysis underscores the complexity of factors influencing hotel booking cancellations. From seasonality to guest behavior, there's a wealth of information that hotels can leverage to enhance their revenue management and guest experience.

🚀 **Implications:**
These insights can guide hotels in making informed decisions – from pricing and promotional strategies to operational adjustments – ultimately reducing cancellations and maximizing revenue.
